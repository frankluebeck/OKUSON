# It takes the output of distribute.py, possibly edited by the user,
# collects people from each group and produces output suitable for
# the file data/groups.txt, where only the id and a group number are
# stored. Groups are numbered from 1 on.
#
# Input is an ASCII file with one line for each person in the format:
#  id:last name:first name:semester:studiengang:wishlist:pdata1-9
# where wishlist is a list of id's of people, separated by commas,
# and pdata1-9 are the 9 personal data fields, separated by :
# characters.
# Such a file is produced by distribute.py.
# Empty lines indicate the separation of groups.
# Lines beginning with a "#" sign are ignored as comments.
# 
# Command line arguments are as follows:
#  inputfile outputfile [firstgroupnumber]
