<!-- Usually you will not have to add or remove any elements in this 
     file but just adjust the textual data between tags. Generally
     white space is removed at the beginning and end of each element.
     See the comments or the manual for explanations.

     This file contains three sections:

       Course section: 
               Every user will have to adjust the values in this section
               to customize things for the specific course.

       Installation section: 
               Only administrators who want to adjust the installation
               to special circumstances need to have a look at this
               section.
               
       Customization section: 
               In this section many aspects of OKUSON can be customized.
               WARNING: Usually one should leave this section alone.
                        He who feels inclined to change anything here
                        should know what he is doing!
