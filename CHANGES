This file documents the changes between released versions of OKUSON.

How to apply an update of OKUSON to earlier releases:
-----------------------------------------------------

In case that you have customized only those file which you have copies from
sample files (Config.xml.sample -> Config.xml, html.sample/* -> html, 
data/empty/* -> data):
  Just unpack the newer archive in the same location where you have unpacked
  an earlier version. 

Otherwise:
  Save files which you have changed and which are not mentioned above.
  Unpack the newer archive. Reapply your changes. (Actually, you may tell
  us which files you want to change, maybe this can be avoided by improving
  the files in the distribution.)

Changes from 1.0-pre2  to  1.0-pre3
-----------------------------------
Attention: The following four configuration options are new in the file
           Config.xml.sample:

           They are all optional and have sensible defaults.
